# ACL2 Experiments

A collection of theorem-proving experiments using the [ACL2](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/) automated reasoning system. This repository focuses on fundamental theorems from [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), adapted from Coq to ACL2.

## Project Goals

- Work through core theorems from Software Foundations Volume 1 (Logical Foundations)
- Explore ACL2's proof automation capabilities
- Document proof techniques and patterns for future reference
- Build a library of reusable lemmas and proof strategies

## Current Progress

**Completed Chapters:**
- ✅ Chapter 2: Basics (arithmetic properties)
- ✅ Chapter 3: Induction (inductive proofs)
- ✅ Chapter 4: Lists (list operations and properties)
- ✅ Chapter 5: Polymorphism (higher-order functions: map, filter, fold)

**Total Theorems Proved:** 50+

See [notes/swf-progression-plan.md](notes/swf-progression-plan.md) for detailed roadmap.

## Key Proof Techniques Demonstrated

- **Selective Theory Control**: Managing ACL2's rewriter with `:in-theory (e/d ...)`
- **Helper Lemmas**: Building proof support for underlying function definitions (e.g., `revappend`)
- **Avoiding Rewrite Loops**: Strategic use of `:in-theory (disable ...)`
- **Custom Data Structures**: Encoding Peano naturals with correctness proofs

See [notes/lessons-learned.md](notes/lessons-learned.md) for detailed examples.

## Highlighted Experiments

- **[fold-product-append](experiments/lists/experiment-02-higher-order-product.lisp)**: Advanced proof requiring selective theory control to manage arithmetic rewriting
- **[Natural numbers encoding](experiments/arithmetic/experiment-04-natural-numbers.lisp)**: Cons-based Peano naturals with correctness theorems
- **[List reverse theorems](experiments/lists/experiment-01-list-basics.lisp)**: Working with ACL2's `revappend` representation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install ACL2 (available via Homebrew on macOS, or from source):
```bash
brew install acl2
```

### Running Experiments

Start ACL2 REPL:
```bash
acl2
```

Load an experiment:
```lisp
(include-book "experiments/lists/experiment-01-list-basics")
```

Certify a book (verify all proofs):
```bash
cert.pl experiments/lists/experiment-01-list-basics.lisp
```

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

The `.lisp` files can be viewed and edited as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). Use the Makefile to keep notebooks in sync:

```bash
# Convert all out-of-date .lisp files to .ipynb
make

# Check which notebooks need updating
make check

# Show status of all notebooks
make list
```

See [utils/README_CONVERTER.md](utils/README_CONVERTER.md) for detailed converter documentation.
