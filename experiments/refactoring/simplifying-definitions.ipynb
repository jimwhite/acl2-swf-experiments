    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a tool, `simplify-defun`, that transforms the\n",
    "definition of a given function into a simplified definition of a new\n",
    "function, providing a proof that the old and new functions are equivalent.\n",
    "When appropriate it also generates termination and\n",
    "guard proofs for the new function.  Since the generated proofs are submitted to\n",
    "ACL2, `simplify-defun` need not be trusted: its soundness only depends on\n",
    "the soundness of ACL2. The new function is a `simplified' version of the\n",
    "original function in much the same sense that ACL2 `simplifies' terms during\n",
    "proofs --- via rewrite, type-set, forward chaining, and linear arithmetic rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Simplify-defun` is one of the transformations of APT (Automated Program\n",
    "Transformations) [citation], an ACL2 library of tools to transform programs\n",
    "and program specifications with a high degree of automation. APT can be used in\n",
    "program synthesis, to derive provably correct implementations from formal\n",
    "specifications via sequences of refinement steps carried out via\n",
    "transformations. APT can also be used in program analysis, to help verify\n",
    "existing programs, suitably embedded in the ACL2 logic, by raising their level\n",
    "of abstraction via transformations that are inverses of the ones used in\n",
    "stepwise program refinement.  In the APT ecosystem, `simplify-defun` is\n",
    "useful for simplifying and optimizing definitions generated by other APT transformations (e.g.,\n",
    "transformations that change data representation), as well as to carry out\n",
    "rewriting transformations via specific sets of rules (e.g., turning unbounded\n",
    "integer operations into bounded integer operations and vice versa, under\n",
    "suitable conditions).  It can also be used to chain together and\n",
    "propagate sequences of transformations (e.g., rewriting a caller by\n",
    "replacing a callee with a new version, which may in turn be replaced\n",
    "with an even newer version, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using simplification rules to transform programs\n",
    "is not new [citation].\n",
    "The contribution of the work described in this paper\n",
    "is the realization of that idea in ACL2,\n",
    "which involves techniques that are specific to this prover and environment\n",
    "and that leverage its existing capabilities and libraries.\n",
    "This paper could be viewed as a follow-up to an earlier paper on a\n",
    "related tool [citation].  But that paper focused\n",
    "largely on usage, while here, we additionally focus both on\n",
    "interesting applications and on implementation. (*Note: We thank the\n",
    "  reviewers of the previous paper for suggesting further discussion of\n",
    "  implementation.  In a sense, we are finally getting around to that!*)\n",
    "Moreover, the new tool was implemented from scratch and improves on\n",
    "the old tool in several important ways, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The new tool has significantly more options.  Of special note is\n",
    "  support for patterns that specify which subterms of the\n",
    "  definition's body to simplify.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The new tool has been subjected to a significantly larger\n",
    "  variety of uses (approximately 300 uses as of mid-January 2017, not\n",
    "  including artificial tests), illustrating its robustness and\n",
    "  flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The old tool generated events that were written to a file; calls\n",
    "  of the new tool are event forms that can be placed in a book.  (The\n",
    "  old tool pre-dated\n",
    "  [-event](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index.html?topic=ACL2\\_\\_\\_\\_MAKE-EVENT),\n",
    "  which is used in the new tool.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The new tool takes advantage of the *expander* in community\n",
    "  book `misc/expander.lisp`, rather than ``rolling its own''\n",
    "  simplification.  Several recent improvements\n",
    "  have been made to that book in the course of developing `simplify-defun`, which can benefit other users of the expander.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of simplification, particularly rewrite rules,\n",
    "is an old and important idea in program transformation.\n",
    "`Simplify-defun` realizes this idea in ACL2,\n",
    "by leveraging the prover's existing\n",
    "proof procedures, libraries, and environment.\n",
    "It is one of the transformations of the APT tool suite\n",
    "for transforming programs and program specifications,\n",
    "useful for both synthesis and verification.\n",
    "While `simplify-defun` is appropriate for equivalence-preserving refinements,\n",
    "other APT transformations are appropriate for other kinds of refinement.\n",
    "For instance, specifications that allow more than one implementation\n",
    "(see soft-2015 for an example)\n",
    "can be refined via APT's narrowing transformation (not discussed here).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used `simplify-defun` quite extensively in program derivations,\n",
    "demonstrating its robustness and utility.\n",
    "This paper describes not only the general usage of `simplify-defun`,\n",
    "but also ACL2-specific techniques used to implement it.\n",
    "It also shows some non-trivial examples that illustrate the tool's utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool continues to evolve.  Developments since the drafting\n",
    "of this paper include: delaying guard verification; and expanding\n",
    "all `LET` expressions, but reconstructing them with `directed-untranslate`.  These enhancements and others will be\n",
    "incorporated into `simplify-defun` when we add it, soon, to the\n",
