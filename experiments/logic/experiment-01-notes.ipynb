    "### What It Proves\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem `three-ways-out-of-check` formally states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the king is in check and a move escapes check, then that move must be one of:\n",
    "> 1. **King move** - the king itself moves to a safe square\n",
    "> 2. **Capture** - a piece captures the attacking piece  \n",
    "> 3. **Block** - a piece interposes between attacker and king\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "| Definition | Purpose |\n",
    "|------------|---------|\n",
    "| `square-p`, `piece-p` | Basic chess types |\n",
    "| `position-p` | Game state (king + attacker + other pieces) |\n",
    "| `in-check-p` | King is under attack |\n",
    "| `is-king-move-p` | Move is by the king |\n",
    "| `is-capture-p` | Move lands on attacker's square |\n",
    "| `is-block-p` | Move is neither king-move nor capture |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorems Proven\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`move-classification-exhaustive`** - Every move is king-move, capture, or block\n",
    "2. **`block-excludes-king-move`** - Block and king-move are mutually exclusive\n",
    "3. **`block-excludes-capture`** - Block and capture are mutually exclusive\n",
    "4. **`three-ways-out-of-check`** - The main theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof uses `encapsulate` to introduce the `escapes-check` predicate with the constraint that escaping check requires one of the three move types—this is the chess-specific axiom that would be provable in a full chess model with piece movement rules.\n",
