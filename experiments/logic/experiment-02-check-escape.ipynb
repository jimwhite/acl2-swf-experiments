    ";;; Experiment 02: Three Ways Out of Check (From Chess Rules)\n",
    ";;; ==========================================================================\n",
    ";;;\n",
    ";;; THEOREM: The only ways to escape check are: move king, capture, or block.\n",
    ";;;\n",
    ";;; PROOF APPROACH: We reason from the rules of chess, not board enumeration.\n",
    ";;;\n",
    ";;; Key definitions from chess rules:\n",
    ";;; 1. CHECK: An opponent's piece attacks the king's square\n",
    ";;; 2. ATTACK: A relationship between attacker, target, and (for sliders) path\n",
    ";;; 3. LEGAL MOVE: Must get out of check if in check\n",
    ";;; 4. MOVE EFFECT: Changes which squares have pieces on them\n",
    ";;;\n",
    ";;; The proof follows from observing that an attack has exactly three\n",
    ";;; components that a move could invalidate:\n",
    ";;;   - The TARGET square (king moves away)\n",
    ";;;   - The ATTACKER (captured/removed)\n",
    ";;;   - The PATH (blocked, for sliding pieces only)\n",
    ";;;\n",
    ";;; Since these are the only components of an attack, and a move can only\n",
    ";;; change piece positions, these are the only ways to break an attack."

    ";;    Instead, block is defined as \"obstructing the path component\"\n",

    ";; 2. The exhaustiveness comes from the STRUCTURE of attacks:\n",
    ";;    - Attacks have exactly these components (by definition of chess rules)\n",
