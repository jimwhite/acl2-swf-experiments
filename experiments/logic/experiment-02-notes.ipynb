    "\n",
    "> If the king is in check and a move escapes check, then that move must be one of:\n",
    "> 1. **King move** - the king itself moves to a safe square\n",
    "> 2. **Capture** - a piece captures the attacking piece  \n",
    "> 3. **Block** - a piece interposes between attacker and king\n",

    "### Theorems Proven\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`move-classification-exhaustive`** - Every move is king-move, capture, or block\n",
    "2. **`block-excludes-king-move`** - Block and king-move are mutually exclusive\n",

    "The proof uses `encapsulate` to introduce the `escapes-check` predicate with the constraint that escaping check requires one of the three move types—this is the chess-specific axiom that would be provable in a full chess model with piece movement rules.\n",

    ";; king-move, capture, or block\" isn't a constraint, it needs to be theorem that is proven true given the rules of chess.  Obviously the total space of all possible board states in which a king is in check is quite large so an exhaustive search isn't feasible, so we need to arrive at this conclusion some other way.  \n",

    "User: I don't think this can be solved by enumerating all the various board positions.  I think you need to work from a the rules of chess and what the imply about the progress of a game.  For example we eliminate a lot of other outcomes by recognizing that to be in check means the other player hasn't made an illegal move and that wer're not in checkmate or stalemate.  I guess there is actually a fourth condition is that the game is draw because of a limit on the number of moves but even so the board position remains in check and so the player didn't get of check, the game just ended in that state.\n",
