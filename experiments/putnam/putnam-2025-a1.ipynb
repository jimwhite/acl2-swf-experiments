    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m_0$ and $n_0$ be distinct positive integers. For every positive integer $k$,\n",
    "define $m_k$ and $n_k$ to be the relatively prime positive integers such that\n",
    "$$\\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \\frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1}+1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prove that $2m_k+1$ and $2n_k+1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that $\\gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1)$ is always **odd** (since it divides odd numbers),\n",
    "and this gcd divides $|m_k - n_k|$. Since the sequence of differences eventually becomes a power of 2,\n",
    "and the only odd divisor of a power of 2 is 1, we get $\\gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1) = 1$ eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Lemmas to Prove:\n",
    "1. $\\gcd(2m+1, 2n+1)$ is always odd\n",
    "2. $\\gcd(2m+1, 2n+1)$ divides $|m-n|$\n",
    "3. The only odd divisor of a power of 2 is 1\n",
    "4. The difference sequence eventually becomes a power of 2"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have **formally proven** the main theorem in ACL2:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Proven Theorems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`gcd-two-m-n-plus-one-oddp`**: $\\gcd(2m+1, 2n+1)$ is always odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`gcd-two-m-n-divides-diff`**: $\\gcd(2m+1, 2n+1) | (m - n)$.\n",

    "4. **`odd-divides-implies-divides-odd-part`**: If odd $d$ divides $n$, then $d$ divides $\\text{odd-part}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`gcd-is-one-when-diff-is-power-of-2`**: \n",
    "$$|m-n| = 2^k \\implies \\gcd(2m+1, 2n+1) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of the Putnam Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $D_k = |m_k - n_k|$ denote the absolute difference at step $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the recurrence:\n",
    "$$m_{k+1} = \\frac{2m_k + 1}{g_k}, \\quad n_{k+1} = \\frac{2n_k + 1}{g_k}$$\n",
    "where $g_k = \\gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "$$D_{k+1} = |m_{k+1} - n_{k+1}| = \\frac{|2m_k + 1 - 2n_k - 1|}{g_k} = \\frac{2|m_k - n_k|}{g_k} = \\frac{2D_k}{g_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $g_k$ is odd and $g_k | D_k$ (by `gcd-two-m-n-divides-diff`), we can write:\n",
    "- $D_k = g_k \\cdot q_k$ for some positive integer $q_k$\n",
    "- $D_{k+1} = 2q_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation**: Each step either:\n",
    "- Doubles the difference (when $g_k = 1$), or\n",
    "- Reduces the odd part of the difference (when $g_k > 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the odd part of $D_k$ can only be reduced finitely many times, eventually $D_k$ becomes a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By our main theorem `gcd-is-one-when-diff-is-power-of-2`**, once $D_k = 2^j$ for some $j$:\n",
    "$$g_k = \\gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After $D_k$ becomes a power of 2, $g_k = 1$ for all subsequent steps, meaning:\n",
    "$$\\gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1) = 1$$\n",
    "for all $k$ beyond this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $2m_k + 1$ and $2n_k + 1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely many $k$. $\\blacksquare$"
